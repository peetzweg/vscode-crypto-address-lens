While developing smart contracts working with addresses is essential. It's very helpful for developers to check this addresses for validity and formatting. Services like the Graph require addresses to be passed all lowercased, were other might not.
Furthermore, it's cumbersome to check on-chain states of addresses. At best the developer never has to leave his IDE and just get all the information about the address inside of it.

With this grant I can extend the support to other IDEs like vim and IntelliJ, as well as implement support for other styles of addresses i.e. used by Cosmos and Solana.
