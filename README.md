Highlights Ethereum style wallet addresses in your code. It will check if it's a valid address and even check if it has a correct checksum if mixed case was used.

See directly if the used address is valid.

It currently differentiates between these four states:

 1. Mixed Cased Address with **CORRECT** checksum

 2. Mixed Cased Address with **INVALID** checksum

 3. All lower cased Address

 4. Not a valid address at all!
